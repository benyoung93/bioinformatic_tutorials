# Bioinformatic Tutorials ðŸ§¬
A repository for tutorials on different bioinformatic analyses. Each analyses will have examples, and all working conda environments and custom scripts present. I hope they are useful.  

## Phylogenomics  
This utilises proteomes (but you can also include whole genomes . . . . ) and single copy orthologs (SCOs) to generate phylogenomic trees. Notably, this includes methods in using >xx% of SCOs in the species, with the relevant scripts to complete SCO entries so that alignments are not thrown off.
